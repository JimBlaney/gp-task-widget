# gp-task-widget

A set of widgts for dynamically building a user interface for a GPServer/GPTask endpoint.

While this project is built using base classes in the dijit namespace, the widgets contained within are "pure-er" HTML, rather than utilizing base dijit CSS. I believe that this not only simplfies the implementation, but leaves a "blank slate" for the integrator to provide styling specific to their needs.
